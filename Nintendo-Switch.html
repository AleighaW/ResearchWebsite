            <p>The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid video game console that lets you either play with Joy-cons connected or disconnected. The Switch came out on March 3rd, 2017. This console has thousands of games you can either purchase from a store or buy in the switch store. The difference between buying from in-store and online is that when you buy online, you can't access your games without wifi.  This is currently the newest console Nintendo has made, but they're working on releasing the second version of the Nintendo Switch soon.</p>
